# PythonChat
This is a chat program that was built under the linux os structure.
Launch ChatServer.py with the script and the port number as the arguments.
This was built to deliverables of my assignment so it uses a static IP and any port number.
Uses sockets and multithreading to handle the communication among the programs/machines.
